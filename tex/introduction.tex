Motivate the reader, the first part of the introduction gives always a
motivation and tries to give the overarching ideas. What I have done. 
The structure of the report, how it is organised. Explain structure of the rapport at the end of intro.

In recent years the applications of Neural Networks have been expanded
massively. There has been done a lot of research into solving PDEs with Neural
Networks, such as the paper (Zobeiry \& Humfeld, 2020)\cite{2}.
Solving/approximating such
systems as the Schr√∂dinger equation or the Navier-Stokes equation with no
closed-form solutions can be very beneficial. 

In this report we will tackle a simple problem, the heat equation in 1D, to see how a Neural Network
performs against a conventional numerical method, the Forward Time Central
Space (FTCS) scheme. To evaluate the methods we choose a boundary condition with a closed-form
solution and look at the difference between this and our numerical solutions.
And to set up the Neural Network we use Keras, which is a TensorFlow API.


The method section first goes trough through the closed-form solution and then
the Neural Network. And the results start by comparison of the mean squared
error (MSE) before looking at the time it takes to solve using the explicit
method versus the Neural Network.
